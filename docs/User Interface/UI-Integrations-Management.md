# Integrations Management

* [ ] **Integrations Management:** A page or modal where users manage external service connections (cloud storage, calendar, messaging integrations, etc.) and view sync status.

  * [ ] **Connected Accounts List:** Show all integrations the user/company has connected. For each, display the provider name (Dropbox, Google Drive, Slack, etc.), the linked account identifier (e.g. Dropbox account email or name), and status (connected/active, or needs re-auth). For storage providers, also show which project or folder is being synced if applicable (e.g. "Dropbox – folder 'Project Sunrise'").
  * [ ] **Connect New Integration:** Provide buttons or options to connect a new account for each supported integration type. Initiating should start the OAuth flow in a new window or popup. Upon successful auth, the UI should update to show the new account in the list and prompt the user to assign it to a project if needed (or this might happen during project creation).
  * [ ] **Integration Details & Actions:** For each connected integration:

    * [ ] Indicate scope and last sync: e.g. for Dropbox, show the folder path linked and when it was last synced or scanned. For communication integrations (Slack, email) show configured channels or usage.
    * [ ] Provide a "Manage" or "Reauthorize" action: If a token is stale or permissions changed, user can re-run the auth flow (especially if we detect token expiration – possibly highlight with a warning icon and label "Reconnect required").
    * [ ] Provide a "Remove/Disconnect" action: Allow the user to unlink an integration. Warn about consequences (e.g. "files will no longer sync" for storage, or "notifications won't be sent" for Slack) and confirm. On removal, update UI to drop it from list and ensure backend stops syncing that source.
    * [ ] If applicable, allow editing settings for an integration: e.g. for an email integration, set the default "from" address or for Slack, choose the default channel for notifications. These would appear in a sub-form when editing the integration entry.
  * [ ] **Sync Controls:** Especially for storage integrations, include a manual sync trigger here as well (redundant to the File Explorer refresh) – e.g. a "Sync Now" button next to the Dropbox account which pulls the latest changes. If pressed, give feedback (spinner or progress bar). Once done or if an error occurs, update status (e.g. "Sync completed at 12:00, 5 files updated" or an error message if failed).
  * [ ] **Status & Error Indicators:** If any integration is in an error state (like failing to connect or hitting API limits), surface that on this page. For instance, an account might show a red icon with a tooltip "Token expired" or "API quota exceeded". Provide guidance to resolve (reauth, wait or contact support).
  * [ ] **OAuth Edge Cases:** Handle OAuth callback errors gracefully. If user denies permission or something fails, show a clear error and allow retry. If the integration requires specific scopes, ensure the UI or documentation instructs the user (especially if they need to check options during auth).
  * [ ] **Future Integrations Design:** Leave space or UI structure for additional integration types (like OneDrive, Calendar, etc.). Possibly group integrations by category (Storage, Communication, etc.) for clarity.
  * [ ] **Security & Feedback:** Remind the user that they can revoke access from the external service side as well. Provide feedback when connecting ("Connecting…") and success ("Dropbox account connected"). Do not expose sensitive info (like tokens) in the UI; just show user-identifiable account info.
