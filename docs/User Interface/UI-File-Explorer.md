# File Explorer (Project Files)

* [ ] **File Explorer (Project Files):** Allows browsing and interacting with the project's unified file system (from connected cloud storage).

  * [ ] **Folder Tree & File List:** Display the hierarchical structure of the project folder (folders and files) in a tree or list view. Users can expand/collapse folders and see files with their name, type/extension, size, and last modified timestamp. Ensure large directories load progressively or with pagination if needed, showing a loading indicator while fetching.
  * [ ] **File Status Indicators:** Mark files/folders with icons or badges reflecting AI analysis status or policy compliance. For example, flag files that violate naming rules or are unclassified, highlight missing required files (expected by policy but not present), and indicate files with pending suggestions (e.g. "rename suggested"). Low-confidence classifications should be indicated (e.g. "?" icon) to prompt user review.
  * [ ] **File Operations & Overrides:** Allow basic file actions through the UI where feasible: open or preview files (in-app preview for common types like PDF, images, text; otherwise via the cloud provider), download files, and possibly upload new files into the project folder. If permitted, allow renaming or moving files within the Explorer, which should create an approval suggestion (or execute directly if user is performing a confirmed action). Manual overrides (e.g. user renames a file via the UI) should still update backend records and the AI should treat it as a user decision (logging it in the ledger).
  * [ ] **Integration Sync Controls:** Indicate the sync status with the external storage (e.g. last sync time or a "up to date" message). Provide a "Refresh/Sync Now" button to manually trigger a sync of the file list from the source, which is useful if webhooks were delayed or after large external updates. Show a spinner or progress while sync is running, and handle sync errors (e.g. lost OAuth token) with an alert (and guidance to re-connect).
  * [ ] **Search and Filtering:** Include a search bar to find files by name or metadata across the project. Results should highlight matches and allow quick navigation to the file's location. Also allow filtering the file list (e.g. show only files with issues, only certain types like "Videos" or "Documents") to help users focus on relevant subsets.
  * [ ] **Right-Pane Inspector Integration:** When a file or folder is selected, display a details panel (inspector) with metadata (name, path, size, modified time, etc.), file preview or content summary (if available), and any AI-generated insights or required actions for that item. For example, if a file violates a naming convention, show the suggested new name and options to approve/modify it right in the inspector. If the file is unclassified, allow the user to assign it a category (affecting policy compliance).
  * [ ] **Error Handling:** Gracefully handle inaccessible files or folders (e.g. if a file was deleted on the cloud side). Show an error state in place (like "File not found or removed") and refresh the list. If the OAuth token is expired (causing API errors when browsing or downloading), prompt the user to reauthenticate (possibly redirecting to Integrations page or an inline re-auth dialog).
