# Olivine Implementation Plan Summary
## Comprehensive Overview of All Implementation Components

### 1. Project Overview

This implementation plan provides a detailed roadmap for building the **Olivine system**, an intelligent file management platform with provenance tracking and automated classification capabilities. 

**What makes Olivine special:**
- **Intelligent Classification:** Automatically organizes files using custom taxonomies
- **Complete Provenance:** Tracks every change with cryptographic signatures
- **Multi-Storage Integration:** Works seamlessly with Dropbox, Google Drive, and more
- **Real-time Sync:** Updates instantly across all connected sources
- **Multi-tenant Security:** Strict data isolation for enterprise use 
The system is designed to handle multi-tenant data isolation, integrate with various storage providers, and provide a robust architecture for scalable file processing.

### 2. Implementation Components

The implementation plan consists of 16 detailed documents covering all aspects of the system:

7. **Taxonomy Classification Agent Implementation** (`07-Taxonomy-Classification-Agent-Implementation.md`) - Automated file classification
8. **Provenance Tracking Agent Implementation** (`08-Provenance-Tracking-Agent-Implementation.md`) - Commit history and audit trails
9. **Sync Agent Implementation** (`09-Sync-Agent-Implementation.md`) - Real-time synchronization with storage providers

#### 2.3 Supporting Infrastructure and Documentation
10. **Developer Documentation** (`10-Developer-Documentation.md`) - Project structure, dependencies, and setup
11. **Security Implementation** (`11-Security-Implementation.md`) - Authentication, authorization, and encryption
12. **Monitoring and Observability** (`12-Monitoring-Observability.md`) - Metrics, health checks, and alerting
13. **Database Migrations** (`13-Database-Migrations.md`) - Migration framework and scripts
14. **CI/CD Pipeline** (`14-CI-CD-Pipeline.md`) - Automated testing, building, and deployment
15. **Error Handling and Recovery** (`15-Error-Handling-Recovery.md`) - Comprehensive error management
16. **UI Specifications** (`16-UI-Specifications.md`) - Frontend architecture and components

### 3. Key Technical Features

#### 3.1 Multi-Tenant Architecture
**Why Multi-Tenancy Matters:** Olivine serves multiple organizations while keeping their data completely separate and secure.

- **Strict data isolation** using `org_id` filtering at all levels - every query includes organization context
- **Row Level Security (RLS)** policies in PostgreSQL - database-level security enforcement
- **Neo4j multi-tenant constraints** and indexes - knowledge graph isolation
- **JWT-based authentication** with organization context - secure token-based access

#### 3.2 Storage Provider Integration
**Why Multiple Providers:** Organizations use different storage solutions, and Olivine unifies them all.

- **Dropbox Business account support** with proper team member ID handling for enterprise accounts
- **Google Drive API integration** with OAuth 2.0 for secure, user-authorized access
- **Real-time sync** using webhooks and Supabase Realtime for instant updates
- **Path-Root header implementation** for namespace differentiation between personal and team spaces

#### 3.3 Agent System
**Why Agents:** Autonomous services that handle complex tasks without human intervention, making Olivine truly intelligent.

- **FileStewardAgent** - Manages file lifecycle, extracts content, and processes metadata
- **ClassificationAgent** - Automatically classifies files using custom taxonomies and machine learning
- **ProvenanceAgent** - Tracks every change with cryptographic signatures for complete audit trails
- **SyncAgent** - Maintains real-time synchronization with all connected storage providers

#### 3.4 Security Framework
- JWT-based authentication service
- Multi-tenant authorization enforcement
- Cryptographic commit signing with HMAC SHA-256
- AES-256-GCM encryption for sensitive data
- Secure OAuth flows for storage providers

#### 3.5 Monitoring and Observability
- Prometheus metrics collection for all system components
- Health checks for databases, queues, and external services
- Structured logging with Winston
- Alerting system with Slack notifications
- Grafana dashboard configurations
