# Olivine Implementation Plan Overview
## Unified, Versioned Knowledge Layer for Creative Production

### What You're Building

**Olivine** is an intelligent file management system that transforms how creative productions handle their data. Think of it as a "production brain" that automatically organizes, classifies, and tracks every file while maintaining complete provenance of all changes.

**Why This Matters:** Creative productions deal with thousands of files across multiple storage systems, with complex relationships and constant changes. Olivine solves this by creating a unified knowledge graph that understands your content and automates the tedious work of organization and tracking.

### Executive Summary

This Implementation Plan provides a comprehensive, exhaustive roadmap for building the **Unified, Versioned Knowledge Layer for Creative Production** - a living production operating system built on a knowledge graph that synchronizes multiple "realities" of a production. The system unifies File Reality (raw storage), Creative Reality (conceptual production elements), Operational Reality (business processes), and Agent Reality (AI actions and audit trails) into a single, versioned, queryable graph database.

### System Vision & Architecture

The platform serves as a **production brain** that:
- **Learns** project details through automated ingestion and classification
- **Remembers** everything with full context and provenance tracking
- **Assists** in planning, logistics, and compliance through AI agents
- **Never forgets** why decisions were made through comprehensive audit trails

### Core Value Propositions

1. **Consistent Automation Across Chaos**: Regardless of folder structures or naming conventions, the system generates consistent outputs (call sheets, schedules, budgets) by referencing the canonical graph
2. **Error Prevention**: Provenance tracking and validation rules catch mistakes early - wrong pay rates, scheduling conflicts, location errors
3. **Rapid Onboarding**: New studios/regions "just work" through learned mapping profiles that adapt to local conventions
4. **Defensible Audit Trail**: Every change is captured as signed, queryable commits with full input/output tracking for compliance

### Key Design Principles

1. **Everything is Versioned**: All changes create new versions rather than overwriting
2. **Event-Driven Architecture**: No polling - all changes propagate via events
3. **Canonical Knowledge Model**: Single source of truth regardless of source formats
4. **Full Provenance**: Every change tracked with who/what/when/why
5. **Multi-Tenant Isolation**: Complete data separation between organizations
6. **Idempotent Operations**: Safe to retry any operation
7. **Defensive Programming**: Validate all inputs, handle all edge cases

### Success Metrics

#### Technical Metrics
- **Data Consistency**: 99.9% accuracy in file-to-graph synchronization
- **Performance**: <200ms response time for 95% of API calls
- **Reliability**: 99.95% uptime with automatic failover
