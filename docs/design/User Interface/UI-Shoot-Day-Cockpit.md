# Shoot-Day Cockpit (Daily Production Dashboard)

* [ ] **Shoot-Day Cockpit (Daily Production Dashboard):** A specialized view for day-of-shoot information and real-time updates, centered around the call sheet for a selected day.

  * [ ] **Call Sheet Overview:** Allow the user to select a shoot day (by date or day number in schedule) and display the finalized call sheet details for that day in a clear, readable format. Key sections (e.g. schedule, crew call times, notes, weather) should be prominently shown, using the call sheet's content. If a call sheet hasn't been generated for that day, prompt the user to create one (link to Composer) or indicate "No call sheet yet for this date."
  * [ ] **Live Updates (if applicable):** If the Cockpit is meant to be used during the shoot day, provide the ability to log or view real-time updates. For example, check-in status for crew (if implemented), mark scenes or tasks as completed, or post announcements. This could appear as an interactive checklist or timeline that crew with access can update (Phase 2 feature). Ensure updates appear in real-time for all viewers (e.g. via WebSocket or real-time DB channel).
  * [ ] **Information Panels:** Include quick-reference panels for critical day-of info: weather forecast (pulled via integration, as in call sheet), emergency contacts (from crew list, e.g. nearest hospital info), and any special notes or last-minute changes. These could be shown in side panels or a highlighted section.
  * [ ] **Integration Hooks:** Provide buttons to distribute or share updates easily (e.g. "Broadcast update to Slack/Email" for schedule changes). If integrated, a producer could send a "call time pushed 30 min" message from the Cockpit that notifies all crew via a connected channel. (This is a Phase 2 integration idea for live comms.)
  * [ ] **Navigation & Safety:** Ensure that from the Cockpit, the user can quickly navigate to related views (like viewing the full call sheet file, or jumping to crew contact info if they need to call someone). The design should emphasize quick access given the time-sensitive nature of shoot-day operations.
  * [ ] **Error/Edge Cases:** If the selected date's call sheet data is incomplete (e.g. missing crew or schedule info), clearly indicate which sections need attention (possibly link back to Composer or the data source). If an OAuth token for a required integration (like weather API or calendar) expired, show an error and prompt re-auth in context.
