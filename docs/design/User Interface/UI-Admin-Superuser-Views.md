# Admin & Superuser Views

* [ ] **Admin & Superuser Views:** (For system admins or advanced project admins) Interfaces for overseeing the entire deployment or performing advanced operations, likely restricted to authorized personnel.

  * [ ] **System Dashboard:** An overview page for the system's health and usage. Show statistics like number of projects, users, recent activity, and status of services (e.g. "All services operational" or if any backend service is down, flag it). Possibly include graphs for active agents, tasks completed, etc., for an Ops admin to monitor.
  * [ ] **User Management:** List all user accounts in the system (email, name, roles, last login). Allow an admin to modify user roles, deactivate accounts, or reset passwords if needed. In a single-tenant environment, this might overlap with project team management, but an admin may have power to see all even if not on a project. If multi-company were allowed, admin would manage those associations, but as single-tenant, likely just one company's users.
  * [ ] **Project Management:** List all projects in the system, with ability to transfer ownership, archive, or delete projects (especially if a user leaves or data needs cleanup). Admin can force-delete if needed, bypassing normal user permissions (with heavy confirmation).
  * [ ] **Integration Monitoring:** Show all integration connections in the system (all users' connected accounts), with status. Allow admin to disconnect any if needed (for security or if user left), and see error rates (like "Dropbox webhooks failing for project X"). Possibly provide tools to re-sync or repair integrations (e.g. re-initialize a webhook).
  * [ ] **System Logs & Debugging:** Access to aggregated logs or recent errors across the system. This could be a simple table of log events (service name, timestamp, level, message) for debugging production issues. Filter by service (Orchestrator, AI Worker, etc.). Also, an admin might view any project's Ops Ledger for audit purposes, even if not a member (depending on trust model).
  * [ ] **Configuration Management:** If there are system-wide settings (like AI API keys, integration credentials for Composio, feature flags for beta features), provide a UI for those. This might be as simple as a list of config variables that an admin can edit (with proper validation and secrets handling). Changes here would likely require a restart or be picked up by services dynamically.
  * [ ] **Admin Actions:** Tools for maintenance, e.g. "Recompute all file embeddings" or "Clear cache" or "Run migration X". These are advanced and should be clearly labeled and confirmed. Possibly hide behind an "Advanced" accordion to prevent accidental use.
  * [ ] **Access Control:** Ensure that only users with the admin role can access these views. If a non-admin somehow navigates there, show an unauthorized message. Also, log admin actions (like if an admin deletes a project, that should be logged in a system audit log).
