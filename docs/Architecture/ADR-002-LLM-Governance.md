# ADR-002: LLM Governance and Usage Policies

## Status
Proposed

## Context
With the introduction of AI agents for content extraction, we now have a dependency on Large Language Models (LLMs) for core system functionality. This introduces new considerations around cost, security, quality, and compliance that need to be addressed through clear governance policies.

## Decision
We will implement a comprehensive governance framework for LLM usage that covers:

1. **Provider Management**
2. **Cost Control**
3. **Quality Assurance**
4. **Security and Compliance**
5. **Monitoring and Auditing**

### Provider Management

- **Primary Provider**: OpenAI will be the primary LLM provider during initial rollout
- **Fallback Providers**: Alternative providers (Anthropic, Azure OpenAI) will be evaluated for redundancy
- **Provider Abstraction**: All LLM interactions will go through a provider-agnostic interface
- **Model Selection**: Specific models will be selected based on task requirements (e.g., gpt-4o-mini for cost-effective reasoning)

### Cost Control

- **Budget Allocation**: Organizations will have configurable budgets for LLM usage
- **Usage Tracking**: All LLM API calls will be tracked with cost attribution
- **Rate Limiting**: Per-organization rate limits will prevent cost overruns
- **Caching**: Frequently requested extractions may be cached to reduce redundant API calls

### Quality Assurance

- **Confidence Scoring**: All AI extractions will include confidence scores
- **Validation Thresholds**: Results below minimum confidence thresholds will be rejected
- **Human Review**: Low-confidence results will be flagged for human review
- **Prompt Versioning**: All prompts will be versioned and tracked
- **A/B Testing**: New prompt versions will be A/B tested before full rollout

### Security and Compliance

- **Data Handling**: No sensitive data will be sent to LLM providers without encryption
- **PII Protection**: Personal Identifiable Information will be redacted before LLM processing
- **Compliance**: All LLM usage will comply with applicable data protection regulations (GDPR, CCPA)
- **Audit Trail**: All LLM interactions will be logged for audit purposes

### Monitoring and Auditing

- **Performance Metrics**: Track accuracy, latency, and cost metrics
- **Alerting**: Automated alerts for anomalies in usage patterns
- **Regular Reviews**: Monthly reviews of LLM usage and costs
- **Incident Response**: Procedures for handling LLM service disruptions

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Controlled Rollout**: Clear policies enable safe introduction of LLM features
- **Cost Predictability**: Budget controls prevent unexpected expenses
- **Quality Assurance**: Confidence scoring and validation improve result quality
- **Compliance**: Clear policies ensure regulatory compliance

### Negative

- **Operational Overhead**: Governance adds complexity to LLM usage
- **Potential Delays**: Review processes may slow feature development
- **Cost of Monitoring**: Tracking and auditing systems require additional resources

## Implementation Plan

1. **Phase 1**: Basic governance framework
   - Implement LLM configuration and provider abstraction
   - Add basic usage tracking and logging
   - Establish initial confidence scoring

2. **Phase 2**: Advanced governance features
   - Implement budget controls and rate limiting
   - Add caching for frequently requested extractions
   - Develop monitoring dashboards and alerting

3. **Phase 3**: Compliance and auditing
   - Implement PII redaction mechanisms
   - Establish audit logging and retention policies
   - Conduct compliance reviews
