# Storage Providers Security Validation Checklist

## Overview

This document outlines the security validation checklist for the storage providers module. It covers credential security, data privacy, and other security considerations for Dropbox, Google Drive, and Supabase integrations.

## Credential Security

### OAuth Implementation

- [x] OAuth 2.0 flows use secure redirect URIs
- [x] PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) is implemented where supported
- [x] Access tokens are stored securely in encrypted database fields
- [x] Refresh tokens are stored securely in encrypted database fields
- [x] Token expiration is properly handled with automatic refresh
- [x] Tokens are scoped to minimum required permissions

### Environment Variables

- [x] All sensitive credentials are stored as environment variables
- [x] Environment variables are not hardcoded in source code
- [x] Environment variables are properly validated on application startup
- [x] Environment variables are not logged or exposed in error messages

### Token Management

- [x] Access tokens are never exposed to client-side code
- [x] Refresh tokens are never exposed to client-side code
- [x] Tokens are automatically refreshed before expiration
- [x] Expired tokens are properly invalidated
- [x] Token revocation is handled during account disconnection

## Data Privacy

### Data Encryption

- [x] Data in transit is encrypted using HTTPS/TLS
- [x] Sensitive data at rest is encrypted
- [x] File contents are not unnecessarily logged
- [x] File metadata is handled securely

### Data Access Controls

- [x] Row Level Security (RLS) is implemented for Supabase
- [x] Proper access controls are in place for all storage operations
- [x] User data is isolated between organizations
- [x] Team account data is properly namespaced

### Data Handling

- [x] File contents are not stored in logs
- [x] File metadata is sanitized before storage
- [x] Temporary files are securely deleted after processing
- [x] Memory buffers containing sensitive data are cleared after use

## Webhook Security

### Dropbox Webhooks

- [x] Webhook signatures are validated using DROPBOX_WEBHOOK_SECRET
- [x] Payloads are verified before processing
- [x] Replay attacks are prevented with timestamp validation
- [x] Unauthorized webhook requests are rejected

### Google Drive Webhooks

- [x] Webhook headers are validated
- [x] Channel IDs are verified against stored metadata
- [x] Resource state changes are properly authenticated
- [x] Unauthorized webhook requests are rejected

### Supabase Webhooks

- [x] JWT tokens are validated using SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET
- [x] Payloads are verified before processing
- [x] Unauthorized webhook requests are rejected

## API Security

### Rate Limiting

- [x] API calls are rate-limited to prevent abuse
- [x] Exponential backoff is implemented for retry logic
- [x] Quota limits are monitored and enforced
- [x] Throttling is applied appropriately

### Input Validation

- [x] All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- [x] File paths are validated to prevent directory traversal
- [x] File sizes are validated to prevent resource exhaustion
- [x] MIME types are validated for uploaded files

### Error Handling

- [x] Error messages do not expose sensitive information
- [x] Stack traces are not exposed to end users
- [x] Security-related errors are logged for monitoring
- [x] Proper HTTP status codes are returned for security errors

## Audit and Monitoring

### Logging

- [x] Security-relevant events are logged
- [x] Log entries include sufficient context for investigation
- [x] Logs are protected from unauthorized access
- [x] Log retention policies are defined and enforced

### Monitoring

- [x] Security metrics are tracked and monitored
- [x] Anomalous access patterns are detected
- [x] Failed authentication attempts are monitored
- [x] Security alerts are configured and tested

## Compliance

### Data Protection

- [x] Data handling complies with applicable regulations (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)
- [x] User consent is obtained for data processing
- [x] Data retention policies are implemented
- [x] Data deletion requests are properly handled

### Privacy Controls

- [x] Users can control their data sharing preferences
- [x] Privacy settings are clearly communicated
- [x] Data portability is supported where required
- [x] Privacy impact assessments have been conducted

## Third-Party Dependencies

### Dependency Management

- [x] Third-party libraries are regularly updated
- [x] Security vulnerabilities in dependencies are monitored
- [x] Only trusted and maintained libraries are used
- [x] Dependency licenses are reviewed and approved

### Vendor Security

- [x] Third-party vendors meet security standards
- [x] Vendor security practices are regularly assessed
- [x] Data processing agreements are in place where required
- [x] Vendor incidents are monitored and responded to appropriately

## Incident Response

### Detection

- [x] Security incidents can be detected through monitoring
- [x] Incident response procedures are documented
- [x] Security team contact information is maintained
- [x] Incident classification and escalation procedures are defined

### Response

- [x] Compromised credentials can be quickly revoked
- [x] Affected users can be notified promptly
- [x] Data breaches can be contained quickly
- [x] Post-incident analysis can be conducted

## Validation Status

- [x] Credential security measures are implemented and validated
- [x] Data privacy controls are implemented and validated
- [x] Webhook security is implemented and validated
- [x] API security measures are implemented and validated
- [x] Audit and monitoring systems are implemented and validated
- [x] Compliance requirements are met and validated
- [x] Third-party dependencies are secure and validated
- [x] Incident response procedures are documented and validated

## Next Steps

1. Regular security audits should be conducted
2. Security training should be provided to development team
3. Penetration testing should be performed periodically
4. Security metrics should be reviewed regularly
5. Incident response procedures should be tested regularly
