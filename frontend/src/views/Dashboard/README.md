# Dashboard Component Structure

This document outlines the structure and organization of the Dashboard feature, which has been refactored into a modular component architecture following Vue 3 Composition API best practices.

## Directory Structure

```
Dashboard/
├── Components/
│   ├── Header.vue
│   ├── QuickActions.vue
│   └── SystemStatus.vue
├── Composables/
│   ├── index.ts
│   └── state.ts
├── Tests/
└── index.vue (Orchestrator)
```

## Component Architecture

### Main Orchestrator
- **index.vue**: The main component that imports and orchestrates all child components. It manages the overall state and handles communication between components.

### UI Components
- **Header.vue**: Displays the page header with title and icon.
- **QuickActions.vue**: Renders quick action buttons for navigation to other parts of the application.
- **SystemStatus.vue**: Shows the current system status with connection indicators.

## Composables Pattern

The business logic has been separated into composable functions following the Vue 3 Composition API pattern:

- **state.ts**: Reactive state variables and computed properties
- **index.ts**: Barrel export file that re-exports all composables

## Styling Guidelines

- All components use scoped CSS to prevent style conflicts
- Components follow the existing design system and Vuetify patterns
- Glass morphism effect is implemented with the `glass-card` class

## Data Flow Principles

1. Main component imports all necessary composables
2. Child components receive data via props
3. Child components emit events for user interactions
4. Composables handle all state management

This structure makes the Dashboard feature more maintainable, testable, and follows the established patterns in the application.
